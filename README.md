# ZKTrustLLM — Artifact & Prototype (Phase 1–5)

Prototype + artifacts for **ZKTrustLLM: IPFS-Anchored Zero-Knowledge Accountability for Secure 5G Edge Multicast**.

## Clarifications (addresses ICC reviewer concerns)
- IPFS is NOT used for live video streaming. IPFS stores audit evidence objects; the live media path remains DTLS/RTP/multicast.
- CID = Content Identifier (content-address for evidence in IPFS).
- ZK = Zero-Knowledge proof attesting properties about (score, evidence commitment, context) without revealing sensitive evidence.
